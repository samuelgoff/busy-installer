# Pillowfort Installer

Primary install path for creating a working Pillowfort/Busy38 system on
Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The platform installer and CLI entrypoints in this repo are the supported
first-time setup path. Other ad-hoc/manual installation flows are legacy
or developer-only.

## Goals

- Shared manifest-driven installation engine
- Deterministic step state (`install-state.json`)
- Canonical-repo mounting for authoritative dependencies
- Local model download staging
- Wrapped onboarding launch and smoke checks

## Quick start

```bash
./pillowfort
./pf
./busy
```

That single command bootstraps the repo-local `.venv` if needed, installs the
runtime dependencies, runs the maintenance-first installer flow, and opens the
correct first-run surface for the current workspace.

The command line stays intentionally quiet, but it does surface:

- the active workspace path
- whether setup/maintenance succeeded
- the exact recovery command and log path on failure
- the exact onboarding or management URL when a browser needs to be opened or
  reopened manually

Installed console entrypoints also expose the same maintenance-first app
behavior once the package is installed into an environment:

```bash
pf
pillowfort
busy
```

Repo-local Windows front doors are also available as `pf.cmd`,
`pillowfort.cmd`, `busy.cmd`, `pf.ps1`, `pillowfort.ps1`, and `busy.ps1`.

The repo-local `.venv` bootstrap is wrapper-owned. Installed console scripts run
inside the interpreter/environment where `pillowfort-installer` was installed;
they do not create a repo-local `.venv`.

Use the repo bootstrap directly when you want a dev/test environment:

```bash
python3 scripts/bootstrap_env.py --dev
. .venv/bin/activate
```

If you want the repo-local commands available from any shell on this machine,
install the public wrappers into your user bin directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_user_commands.py
python3 scripts/install_user_commands.py --status
python3 scripts/install_user_commands.py --uninstall
python3 scripts/install_user_commands.py --shell zsh
```

On POSIX hosts this installs `pf`, `pillowfort`, and `busy` into
`~/.local/bin` by default. On Windows it installs the matching `.cmd` and
`.ps1` wrappers into `~/bin` by default. `--status` reports whether those
targets are managed by this checkout, and `--uninstall` removes only the
managed wrappers. The installed shims are repo-root-aware, so they still
bootstrap the correct checkout even after being placed in another directory.
`--shell` lets the helper print shell-specific PATH guidance for `bash`, `zsh`,
`fish`, `powershell`, `pwsh`, `cmd`, or `sh`. The POSIX shims prefer
`python3` but fall back to `python` when that is the available Python 3
entrypoint on the host. `--force` only replaces installer-managed wrappers; it
refuses to clobber unrelated files already present in the target bin directory.
Generated Windows `.cmd` shims now also quote their internal environment
assignments so repo paths with spaces stay safe. Install now preflights the
whole target set before writing anything, so a foreign target fails closed
without leaving a partially installed command set behind. Windows PATH hints
now avoid the unsafe `setx PATH "%PATH%"` style; `cmd` gets a temporary PATH
command using quoted `set "PATH=..."` syntax plus an explicit pointer to either
System Properties or the safer PowerShell persistence command.

Run tests and the bundled-manifest smoke check from that venv:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/smoke_manifest.py
```

## Branching

- Default branch is `main`.
- Rename-prep and maintenance PRs should target `main` instead of the historical `master` branch.

## Linux install (primary supported path)

From a local clone of `busy-installer`, run:

```bash
cd /path/to/busy-installer
./busy_installer/platform/linux/launcher.sh
```

The platform launchers bootstrap the repo-local `.venv` automatically when
needed, then run the same high-level `busy` / `pillowfort` app path.

Optional environment controls:

- `BUSY_INSTALL_DIR` (install target directory, default: `~/pillowfort`)
- `BUSY_INSTALL_MANIFEST` (manifest override path; default: `docs/installer-manifest.yaml`)
- `BUSY_INSTALL_STRICT_SOURCE=1` (enforce canonical symlink mapping)
- `BUSY_INSTALL_ALLOW_COPY_FALLBACK=1` (permit copied adapter mounts when symlinks unavailable)
- `MANIFEST_UI_OPEN=1` (open local web UI when available)
- `BUSY_INSTALL_ONBOARDING_URL` (override `onboarding_url` from manifest `wrappers`)
- `BUSY_INSTALL_MANAGEMENT_URL` (override `management_url` from manifest `wrappers` when it still targets this machine, such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, or this machine's hostname/IP)
- `BUSY_INSTALL_SKIP_MODELS=1` (skip model staging during install/re-install)

The launcher runs the local checkout directly and writes logs to
`$BUSY_INSTALL_DIR/busy-installer.log`.

Launcher-owned CLI flags are authoritative when provided:

- `--workspace` overrides `BUSY_INSTALL_DIR`
- `--manifest` overrides `BUSY_INSTALL_MANIFEST`
- launcher subcommand parsing is independent of flag order, so
  `repair --workspace /tmp/ws` and `--workspace /tmp/ws repair` resolve to the
  same authoritative command
- relative `--manifest` paths are resolved once up front and reused for both
  launcher reads and the spawned installer process
- launcher-owned flags are parsed once and removed from passthrough so the
  spawned installer command carries one authoritative workspace/manifest value
- once positional passthrough begins before command authority binds, a later
  valid wrapper subcommand now fails visibly instead of being reinterpreted as
  authoritative launcher intent
- once positional passthrough has begun, later launcher-owned flags now also
  fail visibly instead of mutating wrapper authority after the child boundary
  is already established
- duplicate launcher-owned `--workspace` / `--manifest` assignments now fail
  visibly instead of silently last-winning authority
- multiple wrapper subcommands now fail visibly instead of leaking extra
  command tokens into child passthrough
- manifest-owned wrapper booleans are parsed literally, so quoted values like
  `"false"` fail closed instead of enabling browser-open behavior by truthiness

The launcher also accepts wrapper policy defaults from manifest:

```yaml
wrappers:
  open_management_on_complete: true
  onboarding_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8093"
  management_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8031"
```

`MANIFEST_UI_OPEN`, `BUSY_INSTALL_ONBOARDING_URL`, and `BUSY_INSTALL_MANAGEMENT_URL`
override those manifest values.

Manifest-owned wrapper booleans are parsed literally and fail closed on
malformed values.

Post-install browser routing is onboarding-first:

- if `<workspace>/.busy/onboarding/state.json` is missing or not `ACTIVE`, the
  launcher opens the onboarding surface,
- once onboarding reaches `ACTIVE`, the launcher opens the management surface.

Browser-open failures are logged but do not turn a successful install/repair
into a failed launcher exit. Management bootstrap failures are different: if
the installer cannot bring up the local management surface that owns
`http://127.0.0.1:8031`, launcher exits non-zero instead of opening a dead URL.

When possible, the launcher brings the relevant browser surface to the
foreground instead of just printing a URL. On macOS it also makes a best-effort
attempt to focus an already-open matching tab in supported browsers before
opening a new one.

The bundled manifest now uses explicit installer-owned workflow commands:

- onboarding bootstrap:
  `python -m busy_installer.platform.onboarding_bootstrap --workspace . --busy-root busy-38-ongoing --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8093`
- smoke:
  `python -m busy_installer.platform.onboarding_bootstrap --workspace . --busy-root busy-38-ongoing --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8093 --check-only`

These workflow commands are executed from the install workspace. The installer
runtime prepends the local `busy-installer` checkout to `PYTHONPATH` so the
platform launcher works from a plain repo clone without requiring a separate
editable install first. Manifest-owned bare `python` commands are also
normalized to the interpreter that is currently running the installer, so the
bundled manifest remains portable on hosts that expose `python3` but not a
bare `python` shim. The onboarding bootstrap command launches the vendored web
app as a detached background process, then returns only after the local HTTP
surface is reachable.

Management is now installer-owned too:

- the bundled manifest syncs `busy38-management-ui` into
  `busy-38-ongoing/vendor/busy-38-management-ui`
- until the same-origin browser-root fix is merged on the default
  `busy38-management-ui` branch, the bundled manifest pins that repo to the
  reviewed `fix/installer-management-ui-root` branch so fresh installs remain
  self-consistent
- repo sync installs the management backend requirements into the active
  launcher interpreter with
  `python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
- once onboarding state is `ACTIVE`, launcher bootstraps the local management
  runtime, waits for `GET /api/health` on `127.0.0.1:8031`, and only then opens
  the management browser surface

The installer engine supports symlink-first source-of-truth enforcement:

- when source bindings are marked required or `BUSY_INSTALL_STRICT_SOURCE=1` is
  enabled, adapter mounts are remounted to canonical symlinks during install
  and repair,
- copied adapter mounts are only accepted when
  `BUSY_INSTALL_ALLOW_COPY_FALLBACK=1` or the equivalent manifest policy is
  explicitly enabled,
- when explicit copy fallback is enabled and symlink creation fails, installer
  now refreshes the adapter mount from the canonical repo contents instead of
  leaving a placeholder directory behind.

The bundled manifest keeps those canonical bindings optional so a brand-new
machine does not need pre-existing `~/projects/*` checkouts before the first
`./pillowfort` or `busy` run.

Onboarding bootstrap also fails closed on workspace ownership:

- a reachable `127.0.0.1:8093` listener is reused only when local runtime
  metadata for the current workspace and Busy checkout matches and the recorded
  process is still alive,
- otherwise installer raises an explicit conflict instead of silently trusting
  whichever onboarding process already owns the port.

## macOS and Windows one-click

Run the platform-native entrypoints for a wrapped launch flow:

```bash
./busy_installer/platform/macos/launcher.command
```

```powershell
./busy_installer/platform/windows/launcher.ps1
```

Both shell entrypoints route through the same high-level app entrypoint, so behavior is identical:

- dependency bootstrap into the repo-local `.venv`
- maintenance-first command routing (`repair` by default, explicit `install` / `status` / `clean` when requested)
- manifest-driven config and workspace resolution
- one-click wrapped onboarding/management browser open when manifest/ENV policy enables it

```bash
# equivalent explicit mode from the installer repo root
python -m busy_installer.app
```

### Required repositories

The installer manifest marks required repos with `required: true`. If a required
repo fails to sync, the install fails.

The current manifest-required repository set includes:
- `busy38-core`
- `busy38-gticket`
- `busy38-doc-ingest` (mandatory during onboarding/document ingestion setup; adapter mount remains `vendor/busy-38-doc-ingest`)
- `RangeWriter4-a`
- `Blossom`

This list reflects the bundled installer manifest only. It should not be read
as a claim about every Busy runtime required-core ownership boundary outside
installer/bootstrap scope.

The manifest also supports an optional provider-catalog block:

```yaml
provider_catalog:
  enabled: true
  required: false
  url: "https://docs.pillowfort.ai/provider-catalog.json"
  cache_path: "provider_catalog.json"
  timeout_seconds: 6
```

When enabled, the installer will download and cache provider metadata before cloning repositories.

If `required: true`, a missing/failed catalog fetch aborts the install unless a valid local cache exists.

If the request fails and the cache already exists, the engine falls back to cache and continues.

Run the CLI in dry-run mode to preview all steps:

```bash
pillowfort-installer install --manifest docs/installer-manifest.yaml --dry-run
```

The bundled manifest does not stage any default model artifacts. Add model
entries to the manifest only when you have real artifact URLs and checksums to
enforce.
