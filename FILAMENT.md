# Filament Integration

busy-installer is a current or potential downstream consumer and integration
target for Filament when it needs efficient real-time data access.

Rules:

- Filament is the upstream shared realtime transport/runtime/binary layer.
- busy-installer keeps its domain semantics, data models, adapters, caching,
  and rollout logic local.
- Reusable transport, packaging, and portability findings should flow back into
  Filament instead of forking shared realtime glue here.
- Prefer Filament manifests, vendored packages, wrappers, and release assets
  before introducing repo-local transport abstractions.
